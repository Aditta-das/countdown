                                Sometime I think i can do that, sometime i think that i can't. What should I do? I don't know. Machine Learning is my love. I changed my track. Now I am in deep ocean. I am far behind from my Friend. My father wants to lead a simple life. i don't want. I argued with him. There are in old fashion.
                                I started Leetcode. OMG I can't even solve a easy problem. Feeling deppresed. Is there any scope to join a tech company? I think no. All my friends are working on BCS/NSI or Bank Job. I am in such a pressure. I also left my job yesterday. Without money you are not a man. Everyone loves me from class - 0 to university level. After Bsc i start expecting from me.
